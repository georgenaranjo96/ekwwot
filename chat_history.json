You want a VIN scanning app that can decode VINs and license plates, retrieve vehicle details from NHTSA data, and provide common labor times for repairs and quick lube specs. This is an ambitious project, and here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **VIN/License Plate Scanning:** Implement a scanning feature that allows users to scan VINs and license plates using their device's camera.\n-   **NHTSA Data Retrieval:** Integrate with the NHTSA API to fetch vehicle details based on the decoded VIN. Display this information in a user-friendly format.\n-   **Basic UI:** A clean and intuitive user interface to present the scanned data and search results.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important information)\n    *   Primary: `#2962ff` (A vibrant blue for primary actions)\n    *   Secondary: `#64b5f6` (A lighter blue for accents)\n    *   Accent: `#ff4081` (A bright pink for highlights)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White for cards and containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#ffee58` (A soft yellow for highlighting)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Implement the UI:** Create the basic UI for the app, including a home screen with a scan button, a results screen to display vehicle information, and a settings screen.\n2.  **Implement VIN/License Plate Scanning:** Use a library like `expo-barcode-scanner` to implement the VIN/license plate scanning functionality.\n3.  **Integrate with NHTSA API:** Implement the logic to call the NHTSA API and display the retrieved data.\n4.  **Implement Labor Times and Quick Lube Specs:** Research and integrate a reliable source for labor times and quick lube specs. This might involve using a third-party API or database.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nI will now instruct the coding agent to implement the UI and scanning functionality. After that, we can focus on integrating with the NHTSA API and adding the labor times and quick lube specs.\n\n**Instructions for the coding agent:**\n\n1.  Create the basic UI for the app, including a home screen with a scan button, a results screen to display vehicle information.\n2.  Use a library like `expo-barcode-scanner` to implement the VIN/license plate scanning functionality.\n3.  The modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T19:21:41.072534"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a VIN scanning app with NHTSA data integration.
